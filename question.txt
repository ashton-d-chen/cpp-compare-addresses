Compare ItalyFileA.txt and ItalyFileB.txt and create two files:  ItalyUniqueInA.txt and ItalyUniqueInB.txt.  In this comparison:

a.       ItalyUniqueInA.txt should include only the city and town names from ItalyFileA.txt that do not have a matching name in ItalyFileB.txt.

b.      ItalyUniqueInB.txt should include only the city and town names from ItalyFileB.txt that do not have a matching name in ItalyFileA.txt.

c.       You can use any tools you want to do the comparison. That could be a database, writing a program or script to do it, use command line tools, or even using Excel.  You choose the tool.

d.      Both files I’m sending you use the UTF-8 encoding.

e.      Both of the files you send back to me should also be in UTF-8 encoding.

f.        The files contain one city or town name per line.

g.       The result files should have one city or town name per line.

h.      The unique city and town names in the two result files can be any order (they do not have to be sorted or returned in original order).

i.         When comparing names, you should ignore case (i.e. “Tignale” and “TIGNALE” are equivalent)

j.        When comparing names, you should treat punctuation as significant (i.e. “Toscolano-Maderno” and “Toscolano Maderno” are considered different because of the ‘dash’ character)

k.       When comparing names, you should treat accents on letters as significant (i.e. “CITTÀ” and “CITTA” are considered different  because one has an accented A and the other doesn’t)
